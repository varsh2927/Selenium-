# How to Run the Code

## Recommended: Use the Script Launcher

The easiest way to run any script in this project is with the script launcher. It provides a menu to select which script you want to run.

```bash
python run_scripts.py
```

## Run Individual Scripts (Optional)

You can also run any script directly:

```bash
python web_automation.py         # Web automation tasks
python web_scraping.py           # Web scraping tasks
python bot_creation.py           # Bot creation tasks
python web_testing.py            # Web testing tasks
python simple_web_tools.py       # Simple tools (no Chrome driver needed)
python web_automation_windows.py # Windows-specific automation
```

## Diagnostics (if you have issues)

Run these if you encounter errors:

```bash
python diagnostic.py             # Check your environment
python fix_environment.py        # Auto-fix common issues
python test_setup.py             # Verify setup
```
